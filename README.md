# My First Python Project - Python Quiz Game  

This is my first Python project! ðŸŽ‰  

It is a simple **Python Quiz Game** that presents users with a set of randomly selected questions. The questions are stored in a **dictionary**, which is a built-in Python data type that stores data in key-value pairs.  

### Key Features:  
- Uses the **random** module to select 5 random questions from the dictionary using `random.sample()`.  
- Implements `enumerate()` to iterate over the selected questions efficiently while keeping track of question numbers.  
- Accepts user input and provides immediate feedback on correctness.  
- Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.  

This project is a great starting point for practicing Python fundamentals, including dictionaries, loops, functions, and randomization. ðŸš€  

Feel free to check out the code and suggest improvements! ðŸ˜Š
