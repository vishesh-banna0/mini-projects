# My First Python Project - Python Quiz Game  

This is my first Python project! 🎉  

It is a simple **Python Quiz Game** that presents users with a set of randomly selected questions. The questions are stored in a **dictionary**, which is a built-in Python data type that stores data in key-value pairs.  

### Key Features:  
- Uses the **random** module to select 5 random questions from the dictionary using `random.sample()`.  
- Implements `enumerate()` to iterate over the selected questions efficiently while keeping track of question numbers.  
- Accepts user input and provides immediate feedback on correctness.  
- Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.  

This project is a great starting point for practicing Python fundamentals, including dictionaries, loops, functions, and randomization. 🚀  

Feel free to check out the code and suggest improvements! 😊  


# Second Project - Random Password Generator 
# 🔐 Python Password Generator  

This is a **secure and customizable password generator** built in Python. It allows users to generate strong passwords with different character options, ensuring security and flexibility.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ User-defined password length  
✅ Options to include/exclude:  
   - Uppercase letters  
   - Lowercase letters  
   - Special characters  
   - Digits  
✅ Ensures at least one character from each selected category  
✅ Randomized and shuffled for better security  
✅ Input validation to prevent errors
